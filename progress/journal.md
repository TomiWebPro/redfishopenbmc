## 2026-08-26 — agent:opencode — bootstrap

**Done:**
- Created localized issue system: `issues/open/`, `issues/closed/`, `issues/README.md`, `issues/TEMPLATE.md`, `issues/issues.py` (helper CLI: list/show/close/reopen/new/stats/validate)
- Created skill `.opencode/skills/redfish-issues/SKILL.md` so agents auto-load the workflow
- Created `DEVELOPMENT.md` (daily push contract — code+tests+tracking daily, what is/isn't pushed, DoD)
- Seeded 10 starter issues from `documentations/project_goal/goal.md`:
  - #001 P1 chore — Flutter scaffold, tooling, state & CI (blocks all)
  - #002 P1 feature — Redfish client core HTTP/auth/session (blocks #003–#010)
  - #003 P1 feature — Discovery engine (schema-driven capability map)
  - #004 P1 feature — Multi-system manager & dashboard
  - #005 P1 feature — Power management
  - #006 P2 feature — System overview adaptive cards
  - #007 P2 feature — Sensor monitoring realtime
  - #008 P2 feature — Firmware & update management
  - #009 P3 feature — Remote KVM
  - #010 P2 chore — Hardening (secure storage, TLS, theming, a11y, coverage gate)
- Verified helper: `python3 issues/issues.py list/stats/validate` green; `ls -R issues` clean

**Decisions:**
- Issues are git-tracked (not `.gitignore`'d) — history is the audit trail; GitHub mirror gets code+tests+issues+progress daily
- Naming `NNN-kebab.md`, YAML frontmatter contract (`id`, `status`, `priority`, `type`, `created`, `updated`, `closed`, `estimated_tokens`, `labels`), task checkboxes, Redfish Mapping table, Progress Log
- Helper is stdlib-only (yaml optional, regex fallback) so it works without `pip install`
- Estimated tokens per issue to help agent planning; P1→P4 SLA in `issues/README.md`
- Next physical step is #001 `flutter create` + `analysis_options.yaml` + deps + CI; must run before any Redfish code

**Next:**
- [ ] Human/agent picks #001 and runs `flutter create .` (record Flutter version in DEVELOPMENT.md)
- [ ] Fill `.gitignore` for Flutter (done this commit)
- [ ] Daily push: this bootstrap is the first `chore: daily sync`

**Issues touched:**
- #001 opened — ready to start
- #002–#010 opened — blocked on #001 (and #002 for #003)
- Meta: localized system itself — no issue number, bootstrapped here

**Notes:**
- Symlink verified: `/home/tomi/projects/redfishbmc → /home/tomi/projects/redfishopenbmc` (same inode)
- Progress summary initialized (see `progress_summary.md`); next rollup after #001 closes
